It’s recommended to use the Jupyter extension within Visual Studio Code to define and analyze a specific gearbox configuration, as well as perform all the required analyses. The reason is that with Jupyter, the user can write the code in a series of blocks and run each block separately. In this specific context, this allows the user to perform step-by-step definitions and calculations in order to perform all the required analyses sequentially. Having Pylance as yet another Visual Studio Code extension helps the user with recommendations while coding the problem at hand. For example, when defining components by their corresponding characteristics, Pylance will give recommendations on the characteristics that need to be defined based on the Class to which the specific component belongs.

Note that the toolbox relies on Numpy, Matplotlib and Scipy. Therefore, make sure they are installed before proceeding to use the toolbox. In theory, these libraries will be installed automatically with the toolbox but it’s better to make sure they’re there before starting any project. Make sure you have the latest version of the toolbox by first typing python into your cmd then hit enter. Once python is activated, type import pygritbx as pgt then hit enter. After that type print(pgt.__version__) and hit enter. This will print the version number of the toolbox that you have currently installed.

This is because bearings come in different types, each type with its own set of properties. However, some of these properties are shared across different types of bearings (e.g. bearing width, internal diameter, reference speed, etc.). PyGRITbx supports only SKF bearings, and luckily, the SKF Rolling Bearings catalogue is freely available for anyone to download. Using the catalogue, we will define bearing objects by their properties. Some additional properties related to the specific configuration of the gearbox will also be defined and explained in the following. Bearings A and B are given as SKF 30203 (Explorer) bearings. By searching through the SKF Catalogue, we find their characteristics as shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4, in the row enclosed in the blue rectangle. Figure 3 - SKF 30203 (Explorer) Specs 1 Figure 4 - SKF 30203 (Explorer) Specs 2 Similarly, we can find bearings C and D which are designated by SKF 30208 (Explorer). Their characteristics are shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6 in the row enclosed in the blue rectangle. Figure 5 - SKF 30208 (Explorer) Specs 1 Figure 6 - SKF 30208 (Explorer) Specs 2 Based on the information from the catalogue, we can then define the bearing objects in python as follows.

Characteristics are irrelevant. It’s worth spending a couple of words regarding the properties defined which are NOT present in the SKF Catalogue: name: this is simply a label that you are free to choose or simply leave empty. type: this can be either Roller or Pin, depending on the support type. Each shaft is supported by at least 2 supports and it’s necessary to define one of the supports as Roller and the other as Pin. Sometimes this is given in the scheme in Figure 2. In this specific example and by looking at shaft A1, we can see that both bearings, A and B, are Pins; therefore, how do we choose which to define as Roller and which as Pin? The answer: it doesn’t matter. This is because the SKF catalogue provides a way to calculate the axial forces as shown in Figure 7. But don’t worry, PyGRITbx will do this calculation for you. bearingType: depending on the bearing type, this could be Ball, Tapered, or Contact Ball bearing. catalogueType: based on the SKF Catalogue, the bearing could be a Standard or Explorer bearing. shoulder: this parameter is set to 1 if the axial shoulder is located in the positive sense of the shaft’s axis with respect to the bearing and -1 otherwise.

Locations of components belonging to the same shaft is an essential part of calculating the reaction forces produced by the bearings. PyGRITbx gives you the possibility to define the: Absolute location of the component relative to a chosen reference frame defined as a vector. Relative location of the comopnent relative to the rotation axis of the shaft it belongs to defined as a scalar. Depending on the given, one way or the other might be convenient for you. In our example, relative distances between components are given as shown in Figure 8. Let’s break it down one shaft at a time. Figure 8 - Relative Axial Distances - Shaft A1 For this shaft, we have to locate the following components: Bearing A at its pressure center Bearing B at its pressure center Gear R1 at its midplane Bearing A will be located at the origin as shown in Figure 9. Our mission is to calculate $\\mathbf{a_1}$ and $\\mathbf{b_1}$ to locate bearing B and gear R1. Figure 9 - Shaft A1 Scheme However, given that the bearing is a tapered roller bearing, we’re actually saying that the bearing’s pressure center, which has an offset from the bearing’s center point, is located at the origin (point in red circle in Figure 10). Figure 10 - Tapered Roller Bearing Center To calculate $\\mathbf{a_1}$ and $\\mathbf{b_1}$, we will refer to shaft A1’s zoomed-in scheme in Figure 11. Figure 11 - Shaft A1 Relative Axial Distances The distance between the faces of the bearings A and B is reported as 28.75 [mm]. The pressure center of bearing A is offset to the left and that of bearing B is offset to the right. Therefore, to calculate $\\mathbf{a_1}$, we simply have to follow the equation: $$ a_1 = a_A + 28.75 + a_B = 9 + 28.75 + 9 = 46.75 [mm] $$ To calculate $\\mathbf{b_1}$, we have that the distance from the right side of bearing B to the left side of gear R1 is 24.25 [mm]. To that, we have to add the distance from the pressure center of bearing B to the rightmost side of bearing B, and half of the width of gear R1 so as to locate it at its middle plane. To calculate the distance between bearing B’s pressure center and its rightmost side, we simply subtract the offset distance of the pressure center from the width of the bearing. Therefore, to calculate $\\mathbf{b_1}$, we follow the equation: $$ b_1 = (B_B - a_B) + 24.25 + (FW_{R1}/2) = (13.25 - 9) + 24.25 + (30/2) = 43.5 [mm] $$ At this point, we can define the location of all the components on shaft A1 as shown in the following code block: # Shaft A1 Components' Locations a1 = 46.75 # [mm] b1 = 43.5 # [mm] zA = 0 # [mm] zB = a1 zR1 = a1 + b1 # [mm] Note that since these locations are defined as scalars, they are NOT the absolute locations of the components. They actually represent the relative locations of the components with respect to shaft A1’s rotational axis! The aboslute locations of the components will be calculated automatically by the toolbox once we define shafts and meshes. Now let’s switch our focus to the spindle. - Spindle P Locating the components on this spindle is unnecessary for the purpose of the project. In fact, it’s impossible to accurately locate the components on the spindle relative to each other due to missing information. However, we can still make some assumptions so as to portray the locations of the subsequent components in the global reference frame. Components that need to be located are: Gear R2 at its midplane Gear R3 at its midplane For simplicity, we will assume that the location of gear R2 is at the origin of the spindle and that the location of gear R3 is represented by a scalar which is bigger than the sum of half the widths of both gears. That is: $$ z_{R3} \u003e (FW_{R2}/2) + (FW_{R3}/2) = (30/2) + (30/2) = 30 [mm] $$ We will assume it as 55 [mm]. Therefore, the locations are defined as follows: # Spindle P Components' Locations zR2 = 0 # [mm] zR3 = 55 # [mm] Now let’s switch to the final set ","date":"2026-01-31","objectID":"/posts/pygrtibx_tutorial1/:4:4","tags":["Machine Design"],"title":"PyGRITbx - Tutorial Series Part 1: May The Forces Resolve for You","uri":"/posts/pygrtibx_tutorial1/"},{"categories":["Mechanical Engineering","Programming Tutorial"],"content":"Output / User / Load One more step remains before we start defining how all these components interact with each other via shafts and meshes. This is a relatively simple step where we define a generic compnent that represents the output load produced by the user. If you paid close attention to the locations defined in the previous section, you’ll realize there’s a $\\mathbf{z_{Out}}$ defined which I haven’t mentioned before. This is indeed the relative location of the load with respect to shaft A2. From Figure 2, we know how this output load is oriented but we don’t know its magnitude. It’s given as a set of equations (Figure 15) with respect to other loads that need to be calculated first.

Shafts and Meshes are special components in PyGRITbx because they allow us to define how all the other regular components interact with each other. Moreover, the toolbox calculates the absolute locations of all components (if not already defined) using these special components. So without waiting further, let’s start defining these special components. - Shaft A1 I think by now, you got a hint of how the toolbox works: if you want to define a certain component, let’s say a shaft, then you’d need to type something like pgt.Shaft(...) and identify its characteristics in the parantheses. You wouldn’t be wrong to think that; hence, the definition of A1: # Shaft A1 Definition A1 = pgt.Shaft(name=\"A1\", inputs=[input_motor], outputs=[R1], sups=np.array([A, B]), axis=k, loc=[0, 0, 0], material=shaftMaterial) Some words regarding the shaft’s defined parameters: name: this is simply a label that you are free to choose or simply leave empty. inputs: an array of defined objects that represent the input load(s) from the shaft’s perspective. outputs: an array of defined objects that represent the output load(s) from the shaft’s perspective. sups: an array of defined supports that are supposed to hold the shaft. axis: the unit vector corresponding to the axis around which the shaft rotates. loc: a vector that represents the absolute location of the shaft with respect to the global reference frame. material: a defined material object that holds the material characteristics of the shaft. When we execute the code in the previous block, PyGRITbx calculates the absolute locations of all the components involed in the definiion: input(s), output(s), and supports. Now we can move to our first mesh definition. - Mesh M1 To define a mesh, we need to understand which is the driving gear and which is the driven gear. For the mesh between gears R1 and R2, the former is the driving and the latter is the driven. Moreover, we need to understand a property called radiality. Imagine putting your finger on the center of the driving gear, R1, then try to move your finger along one axis or two axes to reach the center of the driven gear, R2, in the shortest way possible. Which axis or axes did you have to follow? The answer to this question is the radiality array. In our case, to go from gear R1 to gear R2, along the shortest path, you need to move along the y-axis in the negative sense; therefore, the radiality is set to -j. One last thing to note is that this is an external gear mesh and not an internal gear mesh. Hence, the definition of the mesh can be seen in the following block: # Mesh M1 Definition M1 = pgt.GearMesh(name=\"M1\", drivingGear=R1, drivenGear=R2, radiality=[-j], type=\"External\") Given that the definition of shaft A1 calculated the absolute location of gear R1, with the defintion of mesh M1 we actually just calculated the absolute location of gear R2. This is because PyGRITbx already calculated all the necessary properties of the gears (e.g. pitch radius), and using the radiality property, it knows in which direction to go to locate the center of gear R2 from gear R1. Now we can define the spindle as another shaft. - Spindle P Similar to shaft A1, spindle P would have a name, inputs, outputs, and sups properties. For the location? Well, given that we know gear R2’s relative location with respect to the spindle and that gear R2’s absolute location has just been calculated by the definition of mesh M1, the toolbox will calculate the absolute location of the spindle automatically. As a result, we can define the spindle as follows: # Spindle P Definition spindleP = pgt.Shaft(name=\"P\", inputs=[R2], outputs=[R3], sups=np.array([F, F]), axis=k) Note that from the spindle’s perspective, it receives an input load from gear R2 (input) and transfers that through gear R3 (output).

We also learnt how to define the interactions between these components using shafts and meshes. Now is the time to harvest some fruits in return: solving for the exchanged forces between components and the reactions produced by the bearings. It’s important to note that approaching such problems is a sequential process. In other words, if you’re solving this project by hand, you would start by the torque equilibrium condition on shaft A1 around the z-axis to get the torque on gear R1 (in this case, it’s the same as the torque produced by the input motor but in the opposite sense). Through the torque, you would then calculate the tangential force acting on gear R1 by dividing this calculated torque by the pitch radius of the gear. After that, you can use the pressure and helix angles to calculate the resultant force acting on gear R1 which you can then resolve into the axial and radial directions. From there, you can apply equilibrium equations and equations given by the SKF catalogue to calculate all the reaction forces produced by the bearings. Sounds hideous? Yes.

Through the process, the toolbox will prompt you with some questions. Let’s see an example by solving for shaft A1: # Solving for shaft A1 A1.solve() Once you run the previous block, you’ll get the output shown in Figure 16. PyGRITbx first checks the torque equilibrium on the shaft around its rotational axis and, if that’s not satisfied, it attempts to resolve it by setting the output torque equal to the input torque but in the opposite sense. If that is done successfully, you’ll get the prompt in Figure 17 telling you that a torque has been detected on the output (in this case gear R1); therefore, would you like to solve for the torque equilibrium of that component around its rotational axis? In other words, would you like to calculate the forces on gear R1? These are the tangential, radial, and axial forces since R1 is a gear. Therefore, our answer should be y.

Once an equilibrium is reached on gear R1, the toolbox switches its focus back to shaft A1 and checks its force equilibrium. If the force equilibrium isn’t satisfied then you’ll get the prompt shown in Figure 19 asking you to solve the reaction forces on the bearings that support the shaft. If you’re interested in the reaction forces, then you should enter y and hit enter. Otherwise, enter n and hit enter. In this case, we are interested so we must enter y and hit enter. Figure 18 - Solving for A1 --\u003e Output 2 Figure 19 - Solving for A1 --\u003e Reaction Forces Prompt Eventually, the toolbox will calculate the reaction forces produced by the bearings, and it will output the relevant messages to confirm that.

The toolbox checks the torque equilibrium of gear R2 around its rotational axis. If that’s not satisfied, it checks for the solvability. Particularly, the toolbox goes and looks at the meshes in which gear R2 is included. If there are torques/forces already resolved in those meshes, then the toolbox will pass them onto the gear. Given that we already solved for gear R1 when we answered yes on the first prompt while solving for shaft A1, the toolbox resolved the torque and forces in mesh M1 in hindsight. Now that we call .solve() on R2, the toolbox finds those torque and forces and applies them onto gear R2.

Congratulations, mastering this part will help you save time solving this project. In short, we analysed the configuration of a given gearbox composed of an input, intermediate, and output shaft. Power is transmitted from the input motor to the output user thanks to the gears mounted on the shafts. All the loads exchanged during the power transfer are supported by the SKF bearings that hold the shafts in place. Through this analysis, we were able to define objects representing these components. We also configured the interaction between said components. This allowed us to model the power flow by calculating the loads exhanged between them as well as the reaction forces produced by the bearings. With this, we conclude the first part of the gearbox components design verification process via a simple toolbox: PyGRITbx. For the next part, we will perform the static and fatigue verification on shaft A2.
