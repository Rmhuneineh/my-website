Hello there!

My name is Ragheed Huneineh, I'm currently based in *Aachen, Germany*, and I've been working on **E-Axle Development & Testing** with different OEMs across the globe for the last 4 years.

I graduated from [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/ "Politecnico di Torino") in 2021 with a Masters degree in Automotive Engineering, specializing in Propulsion Systems development.

My masters thesis at [General Motors](https://www.gm.com/ "General Motors") comprised of developing a comprehensive methodology to perform virtual analysis on the main structural components of combustion engines (engine head and block) via [fe-safe](https://www.3ds.com/products/simulia/fe-safe "fe-safe") under the supervision of [Dr. Cristiana Delprete](https://www.polito.it/en/staff?p=cristiana.delprete).

At the same time, I worked as a **CFD Analyst** at [AEHRA](https://aehra.com/) during the prefeasibility analysis of their 2 exclusive models: [Impeto](https://aehra.com/impeto/) and [Estasi](https://aehra.com/estasi/) under the supervision of *Filippo Perini*. The aim was to define the DNA of the models through the development of a new car segment, aiming mainly at class-leading, high-performance aerodynamics and luxurious, next-generation ergonomics.

After graduating, I felt the urge to work on the field, dealing with components and co-workers rather than just computers and screens. This is when I joined [Dana Graziano](https://www.dana.com/ "Dana Incorporated") as a **Mechatronics Testing Engineer**, working on the *devlopment*, *verification*, and *validation* of **E-Axles** and **Hybrid DCTs**.

After 3.5 years, I decided to make my move to Germany where I'm currently working with [Atesteo GmbH & Co. KG](https://atesteo.com/ "Atesteo GmbH & Co. KG") as an **Engineering Project Manager**. In this role, I'm responsible for discussing and understanding test specificaitons from different clients, preparing test benches with all necessary equipment and instrumentation (dynos, torquemeters, accelerometers, etc.), programming test cycles via Atesteo's own automation system, and data management as well as post-processing in real-time and/or offline.
