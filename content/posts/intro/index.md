# Welcome To My Website
Hello and welcome to my website.

I will attempt to share my thoughts with the interested reader using blog posts. Topics will vary in discipline but mainly I would like to portray my perspective on the following:
+ **Mechanical Engineering**
+ **Programming Tutorial for Engineers**
+ **Books and Recommendations**
+ **Music**
+ **Religion**
+ **Who knows what(?)**

Please note that I will try my best to backup my thoughts and ideas with references that would lead the reader to the source. However, everything I share is based on my humble knowledge and experience on the subject matter and mistakes are to be expected.

This is why I urge the kind reader to reach out in case correction is required, to discuss a topic further, or simply to connect!

I hope you enjoy it :D
