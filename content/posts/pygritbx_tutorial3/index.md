## Outline
In this third and final part of this tutorial series, you will learn how to use **PyGRITbx** to:
1) perform gear tooth bending analysis on gears **R1** and **R3**
2) perform gear tooth pitting analysis on gears **R1** and **R3**
3) perform bearing life analysis on all the bearings inside the gearbox

These analyses are based on the forces calculated in [**Part 1**](https://ragheedhuneineh.com/posts/pygrtibx_tutorial1/ "PyGRITbx - Tutorial Series Part 1: May The Forces Resolve for You") of this tutorial series. Therefore, make sure the code blocks from that part are present in a currently active **Jupyter** session and have already been executed before you try to run any of the code blocks in this part.
