<p>In this third and final part of this tutorial series, you will learn how to use <strong>PyGRITbx</strong> to:</p>
<ol>
<li>perform gear tooth <em>bending</em> analysis</li>
<li>perform gear tooth <em>pitting</em> analysis</li>
<li>perform bearing life analysis</li>
</ol>
<p>These analyses are based on the forces calculated in <a href="https://ragheedhuneineh.com/posts/pygrtibx_tutorial1/" title="PyGRITbx - Tutorial Series Part 1: May The Forces Resolve for You" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "><strong>Part 1</strong></a> of this tutorial series. Therefore, make sure the code blocks from that part are present in a currently active <strong>Jupyter</strong> session and have already been executed before you try to run any of the code blocks in this part.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>PyGRITbx - Tutorial Series Part 2: No Pain No Gain, No Stress No Strain</title><link>https://ragheedhuneineh.com/posts/pygritbx_tutorial2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 13:00:00 +0200</pubDate><author>Ragheed</author><guid>https://ragheedhuneineh.com/posts/pygritbx_tutorial2/</guid><description><![CDATA[<h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>
<p>Hello and welcome to the second part of this tutorial series. In the previous part, we learnt how to:</p>
<ol>
<li>install <strong>PyGRITbx</strong> along with the tools required to work with it</li>
<li>define components that constitute a given gearbox</li>
<li>define interactions between components</li>
<li>calculate the forces exchanged between said components and the reaction forces produced by the bearings.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this part, we will take the results from <a href="https://ragheedhuneineh.com/posts/pygrtibx_tutorial1/" title="PyGRITbx - Tutorial Series Part 1: May The Forces Resolve for You" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "><strong>Part 1</strong></a> to:</p>]]></description></item><item><title>PyGRITbx - Tutorial Series Part 1: May The Forces Resolve for You</title><link>https://ragheedhuneineh.com/posts/pygrtibx_tutorial1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 15:13:13 +0200</pubDate><author>Ragheed</author><guid>https://ragheedhuneineh.com/posts/pygrtibx_tutorial1/</guid><description><![CDATA[<h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>
<p>This blog post is the first part of a 3-part series. In this series, I would like to introduce you to my python toolbox with a tutorial based on a project given to mechanical engineering students following the course <strong>&ldquo;02SXJJM - Fundamentals of Machine Design&rdquo;</strong> at <strong>Politecnico di Torino</strong>. My best hope is that this series would serve as a guide for the reader in future projects concerning geargbox design validation.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Intro</title><link>https://ragheedhuneineh.com/posts/intro/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 18:36:20 +0000</pubDate><author>Ragheed</author><guid>https://ragheedhuneineh.com/posts/intro/</guid><description><![CDATA[<h1 id="welcome-to-my-website">Welcome To My Website</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to my website.</p>
<p>I will attempt to share my thoughts with the interested reader using blog posts. Topics will vary in discipline but mainly I would like to portray my perspective on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mechanical Engineering</strong></li>
<li><strong>Programming Tutorial for Engineers</strong></li>
<li><strong>Books and Recommendations</strong></li>
<li><strong>Music</strong></li>
<li><strong>Religion</strong></li>
<li><strong>Who knows what(?)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that I will try my best to backup my thoughts and ideas with references that would lead the reader to the source. However, everything I share is based on my humble knowledge and experience on the subject matter and mistakes are to be expected.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
