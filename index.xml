<p>Hello and welcome to my website.</p>
<p>I will attempt to share my thoughts with the interested reader using blog posts. Topics will vary in discipline but mainly I would like to portray my perspective on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mechanical Engineering</strong></li>
<li><strong>Programming Tutorial for Engineers</strong></li>
<li><strong>Books and Recommendations</strong></li>
<li><strong>Music</strong></li>
<li><strong>Religion</strong></li>
<li><strong>Who knows what(?)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that I will try my best to backup my thoughts and ideas with references that would lead the reader to the source. However, everything I share is based on my humble knowledge and experience on the subject matter and mistakes are to be expected.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
